# IETF 123 side meeting on (Inter) Networking for AI 

The idea to have this side meeting sparkled from several observations.

First, generative AI systems are approaching a scalability limit in their development. To bypass this limit, it becomes necessary to train those models beyond the realm of a single datacenter.

Besides, as the adoption of services based on generative AI is ramping up, some modes of operation ask for stringent quality of service levels in order to meet users demand. Meeting those requirements can be adressed by using systems mixing powerful computing instances residing in cloud platforms with localized edge platforms, using heterogeneous and distributed systems.

At the same time, questions arise related to the governance and operational models of generative AI services, in particular due to data ownership and trustworthiness aspects. Those concerns can find a solution in federated learning systems, in which data ownership can be retained, and models are trained among several stakeholders.

Those three observations have raised numerous questions in the Internet community in general to determine how the necessary distribution of generative AI systems beyond the realm of single datacenters will impact the Internet at large. During this side meeting, our goal is to favour a discussion to examine how to address inter-networking challenges of AI workloads operation at scale.
